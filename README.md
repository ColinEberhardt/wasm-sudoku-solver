# WebAssembly Powered Augmented Reality Sudoku Solver

![](sudoku-solver.gif)

You can find a [brief tutorial that describes this project on my blog](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2020/01/03/webassembly-sudoku-solver.html).

> This project makes use of the WebAssembly build of OpenCV (a C++ computer vision library), Tensorflow (a machine learning library) and a solver written in Rust. It neatly demonstrates how WebAssembly allows you to write performance-critical web-based applications in a wide range of languages.
